This e-mail contains SLOSHXL_GUI V0.4 (February 2018).

SLOSHXL_GUI the Excel-based application of the SLOSH code previously distributed by SwRI.
SLOSHXL_GUI is meant to follow the flow and feel of the SLOSH code within the framework of Excel forms.  

The revisions in this version are as follows:
1. Inserted instruction I.2 to replace the pathname of the DLL to the path where the
   user stored the DLL after copyin to the user's computer.
2. Rebuilt DLL to use only Windows system libraries and DLL's
3. Changed definition of PicWidth, PicHeight in subroutine DrawBox to remove an error condition
   that occurs in Excel 2016 
4. Corrected an error in the conical tank damping calculations for radians-degrees conversions.

Please provide feedback to me about possible bugs and operational problems.  
I will repair the bugs and address suggested changes for operational problems if feasible;
however, future revisions of this (free) software will be distribute as I find time.
    
Thank you for your interest.
